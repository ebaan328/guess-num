Headline:

Guess num (project #1)

Body: code Breakdown

the game is going to be prompt based, input and output being done through the command line.

multiple variables must be created to store different anwers; that would be 3 per prompt.

methods I plan on using as of the start of the project:

		-print statements(main source of communication with user and game)

		-if statements(for qualification and disqualification functinality)

		-switch statement(different prompts come with different answers)

		-loops(for wrong answer errors)

		-methods(storing & reusing data)


prompts should range from 5-10; theyll be stored in a method of their own, or if possible, one method storing all of them.

each prompt will grant 3 tries while giving a warmer/colder alert on wrong anwers when getting closer or farther from the correct answer.
once 3 tries the user is disqualified. a if statement will be set to once the 3 tries have been used; the user will no longer be able to participate and will have to restart the game by re-entering the initiation password.

the initiation password will be a key word: start.

once the if condition is met (which is start), the game will begin.

welcome message,

instructions,

first prompt,

second prompt,

etc..

classes will be used to distribute the different parts of the program for concept practice.
